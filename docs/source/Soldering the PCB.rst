Soldering the PCB
#################
.. note::
    Prerequisites:

    * 1x Mathboard PCB
    * 1x `0xCB Helios RP2040 microcontroller <https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios>`_
    * 2x `Gateron KS-33 Low Profile v2 switches <https://www.gateron.co/products/gateron-low-profile-mechanical-switch-set>`_
    * 1x :ref:`Assembled lid <Assembling the lid>`.


The Mathboard has been designed to be as easy to make as possible. As such, the PCB only uses through-hole
components for the parts that must be soldered by hand. Through-hole components are easy to solder even with very
low quality soldering irons and no previous experience.

.. warning::
    Do not solder the microcontroller before you solder the top two Gateron switches, as their solder points are
    covered by the microcontroller.
