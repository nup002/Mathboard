Mathboard V1 assembly manual
============================
This part of the documentation is intended for those who wish to build their own Mathboard V1. If you are instead
looking for documentation on how to use the Mathboard, see :ref:`user_manual`.

Assembling your own Mathboard from scratch typically takes one hour once you have all the parts ready. Once you're
finished, head over to :ref:`first_setup` to set it up for use.
