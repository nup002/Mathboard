# Materials, tools, and components
The Mathboard is a very simple device that should be possible to build by nearly anyone. The following two lists 
tells you everything you need to assemble your own.

## Components

* 1x Mathboard PCB
* 1x Mathboard case (bottom, lid, and LED diffuser)
* 1x 0xCB Helios RP2040 microcontroller (https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios)
* 1x WS2812 or WS2812B addressable LED
* 1x USB-C cable
* 1x set of UV-printed 1u OEM R2 keycaps
* 2x 1u keycap of your choice
* 2x 1.5u keycap of your choice
* 3x self-tapping screws of length 6mm, width 2.2mm, head diameter max 4mm.
* 4x rubber feet. Maximum footprint: 1cm x 1cm

## Tools and supplies

* A 3D printer, for printing the case and LED diffuser.
* White PLA filament for the LED diffuser.
* Any color PLA filament, for the case.
* A Phillips head screwdriver, to insert the screws that hold the case together
* A soldering iron (plus solder) to solder the keyboard switches and the microcontroller
* A wire clipper, to cut the microcontroller pins short after soldering
* Cyanoacrylate glue (AKA super glue), for gluing the LED diffuser to the case lid.
